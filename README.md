# Newton's Apple 🍏

> *"Oh look, humans reinvented gravity… again. How original."* – GLaDOS

Newton’s Apple is a physics measurement tool powered by **ESP8266**, **ultrasonic sensor**, **MPU6050 (accelerometer + gyroscope)**, and a **light sensor**.  
It measures distance, acceleration, projectile motion, freefall, and even gravity itself – you know, the thing that’s been ruining your dreams of flight since forever.

## ✨ Features
- 📏 **Distance Measurement** – Ultrasonic sensor: because rulers are too mainstream.  
- 🌀 **Acceleration & Gyroscope** – MPU6050: tracks your every clumsy move.  
- 🌌 **Projectile Motion & Freefall** – Yes, throw it. Don’t worry… it *might* survive.  
- 💡 **Light Sensor** – Detects brightness. Unlike you.  
- 📊 **Graphical UI** – Because raw numbers are boring.

## 🛠️ Materials Used
- ESP8266 (the brain 🧠 – although "brain" is a generous word)  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (for distance)  
- MPU6050 (accelerometer + gyroscope)  
- Light Sensor (to make it feel important)  
- A UI for data plotting (so it looks cooler than it actually is)  

---

## ⚡ How It Works
1. ESP8266 collects sensor data.  
2. Data is plotted in a UI (graphs = instant science).  
3. You throw the device, and it measures gravity, freefall, and projectile motion.  
4. If it breaks… congratulations, you’ve discovered fragility.

## 📸 Demo
*(Insert your GIFs, images, or videos here of Newton’s Apple in action. Preferably something exploding.)*

## 🤖 Future Plans
- Add more sensors, because why stop now?  
- Cloud logging, so you can waste storage on your terrible throws.  
- Maybe AI integration… so it can laugh at you in real time.  

---

## 🧪 Utilities
- Learn about **gravity** without dropping fruit on your head.  
- Demonstrate **motion, acceleration, and freefall** like a proper mad scientist.  
- Impress teachers, confuse friends, and terrify apples everywhere.  

---

## 🪦 Conclusion
Congratulations. You built Newton’s Apple.  
You can now:  
- Measure gravity.  
- Plot projectile motion.  
- And drop things in the name of science.
